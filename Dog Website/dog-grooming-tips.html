                    <h3>Bathing Your Dog</h3>
                    <p>
                        We recommend bathing your dog at least once every three months, but some may require more frequent baths if he or she spends a 
                        lot of time outdoors or has skin problems. Here are some steps to help you get started.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day. </li>
                        <li> Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
                        <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
                        <li> When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
                        <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>   
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Dogs with loose facial skin or wrinkles—such as Shar Peis and 
                        Pugs—will need special attention. To prevent dirt and bacteria from causing irritation and infection, clean the folds with 
                        damp cotton. Always thoroughly dry the areas between the folds.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bathing a Puppy</h4>
                    <p>Some pups think that bath time is a perfect time to act goofy! Young puppies especially will wiggle and bounce all over the place, 
                        and tend to nip at bath time. If this sounds like your pet, put a floating toy in the tub with her so she can focus on that rather than on mouthing you.</p>
                    <h4> Choosing a Shampoo </h4>
                    <p>Using a shampoo formulated for pets is best. Human shampoos aren't toxic to pets, but some may contain fragrances or other substances that can irritate your pet's skin. Select a product that's specifically formulated for your species of animal, as some ingredients may be harmful when applied to different types of pets. It's always smart to talk with your pet's 
                        veterinarian to make sure you're selecting a shampoo that will meet your pet's needs.</p>
                        <h4> Protecting Your Dog’s Eyes and Ears During Bath Time</h4>
                        <p>Since shampoos and soaps can be major irritants, ask your vet for a sterile eye lubricant to use during bathing—this will help protect your pet's eyes from shampoo. You can also use a sprayer or a showerhead with a long hose, allowing you to control water flow during rinsing.  
                            Avoid shampooing your pet's head altogether by simply using a wet washcloth to gently remove any dirt or debris from his or her face.</p>
