                    <h3>Bathing Your Dog</h3>
                    <p>
                        We recommend bathing your dog at least once every three months, but some may require more frequent baths if he or she spends a 
                        lot of time outdoors or has skin problems. Here are some steps to help you get started.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day. </li>
                        <li> Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
                        <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
                        <li> When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
                        <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>   
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Dogs with loose facial skin or wrinkles—such as Shar Peis and 
                        Pugs—will need special attention. To prevent dirt and bacteria from causing irritation and infection, clean the folds with 
                        damp cotton. Always thoroughly dry the areas between the folds.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bathing a Puppy</h4>
                    <p>Some pups think that bath time is a perfect time to act goofy! Young puppies especially will wiggle and bounce all over the place, 
                        and tend to nip at bath time. If this sounds like your pet, put a floating toy in the tub with her so she can focus on that rather than on mouthing you.</p>
                    <h4> Choosing a Shampoo </h4>
                    <p>Using a shampoo formulated for pets is best. Human shampoos aren't toxic to pets, but some may contain fragrances or other substances that can irritate your pet's skin. Select a product that's specifically formulated for your species of animal, as some ingredients may be harmful when applied to different types of pets. It's always smart to talk with your pet's 
                        veterinarian to make sure you're selecting a shampoo that will meet your pet's needs.</p>
                        <h4> Protecting Your Dog’s Eyes and Ears During Bath Time</h4>
                        <p>Since shampoos and soaps can be major irritants, ask your vet for a sterile eye lubricant to use during bathing—this will help protect your pet's eyes from shampoo. You can also use a sprayer or a showerhead with a long hose, allowing you to control water flow during rinsing.  
                            Avoid shampooing your pet's head altogether by simply using a wet washcloth to gently remove any dirt or debris from his or her face.</p>

                    <h3>Brushing Your Dog</h3>
                    <p>
                        Regular grooming with a brush or comb will help keep your pet's hair in good condition by removing dirt, spreading natural oils throughout her coat, preventing tangles and keeping her skin clean and irritant-free. 
                        Plus, grooming time is a great time to check for fleas and flea dirt—those little black specks that indicate your pet is playing host to a flea family.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Smooth, Short Coats</h4>
                    <p>If your dog has a smooth, short coat (like that of a Chihuahua, Boxer or Basset Hound), 
                        you only need to brush once a week. Use a rubber brush to loosen dead skin and dirt and follow with bristle brush to remove dead hair. Polish your low-maintenance pooch with a chamois cloth and she's ready to shine!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Short, Dense Fur</h4>
                    <p>
                        If your dog has short, dense fur that's prone to matting, like that of a retriever, 
                        brushing once a week is fine. Use a slicker brush to remove tangles and catch dead hair with a bristle brush. Don't forget to comb her tail!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Long, Silky Coats</h4>
                    <p>If your dog has a long, luxurious coat, such as that of a Yorkshire terrier, she'll need daily attention. Every day you'll need to remove tangles with a slicker brush. Next, brush her coat with a bristle brush. If you have a long-haired dog with a 
                        coat like a collie's or an Afghan hound's, follow the steps above, but also be sure to comb through the fur and trim the hair around the feet.</p>
                    <h4> Long Hair That's Frequently Matted </h4>
                    <p>For long-haired pooches, it's a good idea to set up a daily grooming routine to remove tangles and prevent mats. Gently tease out tangles with a slicker brush, and then brush your pet with a bristle brush. If matting is particularly dense, you may try clipping the hair, taking care not to come near the skin.</p>

                    <h3>Eye care</h3>
                    <p>
                        Giving your pup regular home eye exams will help keep you alert to any tearing, cloudiness or inflammation that may indicate a health problem. First, face your dog in a brightly lit area and look into his eyes. They should be clear and bright, and the area around the eyeball should be white. The pupils should be equal in size and there shouldn’t be tearing, discharge or any crust in 
                        the corners of his eyes. With your thumb, gently roll down your dog’s lower eyelid and look at the lining. It should be pink, not red or white.
                    </p>
                    <p> A gentle wipe with a damp cotton ball will help to keep your pet’s eyes gunk-free. Wipe outward from the inner corner of the eye and be careful not to touch his or her eyeball—you don’t want to scratch the cornea! 
                        If your pet constantly suffers from runny eyes and discharge, please see your veterinarian. Your pet may have an infection or plugged tear ducts.</p>
                    <h4>Symptoms of Eye Infection
                    </h4>
                    <p>The following are signs that something may be wrong with one or both of your dog’s eyes. Be sure to watch your pooch’s body language, too—pawing or rubbing
                         his eye area may indicate possible problems. Call your veterinarian if your dog is experiencing any of these symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discharge and crusty gunk</li>
                        <li>Tearing</li>
                        <li>Red or white eyelid linings</li>
                        <li>Tear-stained fur</li>
                        <li>Closed eye(s)</li>
                        <li>Cloudiness or change in eye color</li>
                        <li>Visible third eyelid</li>
                        <li>Unequal pupil size</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Common Eye Problems in Dogs</h4>
                    <p>
                        The following eye-related disorders are commonly seen in dogs:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Conjunctivitis:</strong> One or both of your dog’s eyes will look red and swollen, and there may be discharge</li>
                        <li><strong>Dry Eye:</strong> Diminished tear production can cause corneal inflammation, squinting and discharge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Epiphora:</strong> An overflow of tears creates stains on the dog’s facial fur.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cherry Eye:</strong> An enlarged tear gland forms a cherry-like mass in the corner of the dog's eye.</li>
                        <li><strong>Glaucoma:</strong> The cornea may become cloudy and the eye enlarges due to an increased pressure in the eyeball.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ectropion:</strong> A turning outward of the eyelid away from the eye (lower lids may look droopy).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cataract:</strong> An opacity on the lens of the eye can cause impaired vision and possible blindness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Retinal Atrophy:</strong> Caused by degeneration of retinal tissue—night blindness is often its first sign.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Preventing Eye Problems</h4>
                    <p>Long-haired breeds can get eye damage if their locks aren’t tamed. Carefully trim the hair around your dog’s eyes to keep his vision clear and prevent hairs from poking and
                         scratching. Soaps and topical medications can be major irritants, so sure to protect your dog’s eyes before bathing him or applying ointments or flea-control formulas.</p>
        
                    <p>It’s much safer to drive with the windows only partially down and your dog’s head inside the vehicle to prevent pain or long-last injury from road debris
                         or an insect getting in her eyes. The wind can also dry out your dog’s eyes, possibly causing irritation and infection.</p>
                    <p>Consider doing a little research to find out if your dog’s breed is predisposed toward eye conditions, such as glaucoma or progressive retinal atrophy. 
                        Your pet should have his eyes checked on annual vet visits, but knowing about possible inherited problems will help you take important precautions.</p>

                    <h3>Ear Care</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your dog’s regular grooming routine should include regular ear checks. This is especially important for dogs who produce excessive earwax or have a lot of inner-ear hair. Don’t clean your dog’s ears so 
                        frequently or deeply as to cause irritation, and take care to never insert anything into your dog’s ear canal—probing inside can cause trauma or infection!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your dog’s inner ears appear dirty, clean them with a
                             cotton ball or piece of gauze dampened with mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide or a liquid ear cleaner specially formulated for this purpose.</li>
                             <li>Fold your pet’s ear back gently and wipe away any debris or earwax that you can see on the underside of his or her ear.</li>
                             <li>Be sure to lift away the dirt and wax rather than rubbing it into the ear.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Recognizing an Ear Infection</h4>
                    <p>Because a dog’s ear canals plunge downward and then horizontally from the ear opening, it is difficult for caught debris or water to be released, making canines especially susceptible to ear infections. Check your dog’s ears regularly for discharge,
                         odor, swelling and other signs of infection. If your dog is showing any of the symptoms described below, see your veterinarian as soon as possible.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ear scratching</li>
                        <li>Brown, yellow or bloody discharge</li>
                        <li>Odor in the ear</li>
                        <li>Redness</li>
                        <li>Swelling</li>
                        <li>Crusted or scabby skin on the near ear flap</li>
                        <li>Hair loss around the ear</li>
                        <li>Wiping the ear area on the floor or furniture</li>
                        <li>Head shaking or head tilt</li>
                        <li>Loss of balance</li>
                        <li>Unusual eye movements</li>
                        <li>Walking in circles</li>
                        <li>Hearing loss</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Ear Care for Dogs Who Swim</h4>
                    <p>
                        Frequent bathing or swimming can lead to ear irritation and infection. To prevent this from happening,
                         place cotton in your dog’s ears before baths and be sure to dry his or her ears thoroughly after water sports and activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your dog is prone to ear infections, as your veterinarian to recommend an ear drying solution made for dogs to help 
                        evaporate any water trapped inside the ear canal. These ear washes, usually witch hazel-based, are available at better pet supply stores.</p>
                    <h4>Signs of Ear Problems</h4>
                    <p>Because of the twisty, curvy design a dog’s inner ears, it’s easy for parasites, bacteria and yeast to hide in them and infections can often arise as a result of this trapped debris. Dogs with allergies are particularly vulnerable to complications, as are those with floppy ears, like Cocker spaniels, Basset Hounds and Poodles. Brown or black ear wax—and dry, dark wax 
                        resembling coffee grounds—are classic indicators of microscopic ear mites. Only your vet can tell for sure, so please don’t delay bringing your pooch in for a checkup.</p>
                    <p>Contact your veterinarian if you notice any of the following symptoms affecting your dog’s ears.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ear discharge</li>
                        <li>Bad smells</li>
                        <li>Redness</li>
                        <li>Swelling</li>
                        <li>Crusty skin</li>
                        <li>Hair loss</li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Paw Care</h3>
                    <p>
                        The pads on the bottom of your pups feet provide extra cushioning to help protect bones and joints from shock, provide insulation against extreme weather, aid walking on rough ground and protect tissue deep within the paw. 
                        It’s important to check your pet’s feet regularly to make sure they’re free of wounds, infections or foreign objects that can become lodged.
                    </p>
                    <p>To keep them in tip-top shape, look for foxtails, pebbles, small bits of broken glass and other debris. 
                        Remove any splinters or debris gently with tweezers. Then, comb and trim the hair between the toes to be even with the pads to avoid painful matting.</p>
                    <h4>Using Moisturizer</h4>
                    <p>If your dog’s pads have become cracked and dry, ask your veterinarian for a good pad moisturizer and use as directed. Avoid human hand moisturizers, which can soften the pads and lead to injury. 
                        A paw message will relax your dog and promote better circulation. Start by rubbing between the pads on the bottom of the paw, and then rub between each toe.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Treating Wounds</h4>
                    <p>
                        It’s not unusual for dogs to suffer cuts or wounds from accidently stepping on glass, debris or other objects. Wounds that are smaller than a half inch in diameter can be cleaned with an antibacterial wash and wrapped with a light bandage. For deeper paw cuts, see your veterinarian for treatment.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Winter and Summer Paw Care</h4>
                    <p>As with humans, your dog’s paws will require different types of care depending on the season. The bitter 
                        cold of winter can cause chapping and cracking in your dog’s paws. Rock salt and chemical ice melters can cause sores, infection and blistering,
                         and toxic chemicals can also be ingested by your dog when he licks his paws. Beat these wintertime blues by washing your dog’s paws in warm water after outdoor walks 
                        to rinse away salt and chemicals. You may wish to apply Vaseline, a great salt barrier, to your pet’s pads before each walk—or make sure your dog wears doggie booties.</p>
                        <p>During the summer, it’s important to remember your dog’s paws feel heat extremes. Just imagine stepping barefoot onto hot pavement—ouch! To prevent burns and blisters, avoid walking your dog on hot pavement or sand. Watch for blisters, loose flaps of skin and red, ulcerated patches on your pet’s pads. 
                            For minor burns, apply antibacterial wash to the paw and cover with a loose bandage. For serious burns, please visit your vet immediately.</p>
                    <h4> Preventing Paw Problems </h4>
                    <p>When starting a new exercise program with your dog, start off slow. Paws may become sensitive, chaffed or cracked, particularly when starting your dog out on hikes or runs. Be sure to keep your home and yard clear of pointy bits and pieces, and avoid 
                        hazards such as broken glass and other debris when walking your dog. Always keep this simple tip in mind—if you wouldn’t like to walk barefoot on it, neither will your dog!</p>
